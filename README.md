## To Use

**Please make sure there is a folder named saved_model in the same path of the program.**

The only thing that needs to do is to run the trauin_Le.py. It will begin at train the original LeNet_300_100 model and then pruning the model and pruning with compensating. Finally will test each model's accuracy.
